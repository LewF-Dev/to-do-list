# To-Do List Application

## Overview

The To-Do List application is a full-stack web application built using the Django framework. It allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. The application implements user authentication, including registration, login, and role-based permissions. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app is responsive and designed with a user-friendly interface that adheres to accessibility guidelines and UX principles.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a responsive and accessible to-do list application where users can:
- Create, update, and delete tasks.
- Track task completion.
- Manage tasks using a profile with an editable profile picture.
- Access the application via secure role-based authentication.

This project demonstrates the full-stack development of a web application using Django, and follows the principles of good UX design, security practices, and data handling.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. Passwords are hashed, and sensitive data is stored securely.
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Each task includes a title, description, date, and time.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile picture and manage their personal details.
- **Calendar Integration**: Tasks are displayed on a calendar view, allowing users to visualize their tasks by date.
- **Performance-Based Statistics**: Users can see insights and statistics based on their task completion performance.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and accessible, ensuring a good user experience across all devices.

## UX Design

### Target Audience
- Busy individuals looking for a simple tool to organize and manage their daily tasks.
- Users who value a streamlined, no-nonsense interface with minimal distractions.

### Wireframes and Design Decisions
The application's design is based on the principles of good UX:
- **Information Hierarchy**: Tasks and controls are clearly organized for ease of use. Priority tasks are emphasized.
- **User Control**: All user interactions provide immediate feedback. For example, when tasks are completed, the user receives confirmation.
- **Accessibility**: The design follows accessibility guidelines, ensuring proper color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility.

### Mockups
Mockups for each page of the application, including:
1. **Home Page** - Displays tasks and allows interaction (edit, delete, complete).
2. **Profile Page** - Allows users to update their profile picture and details.
3. **Task Calendar** - Visualizes tasks on a calendar interface.

Mockups and wireframes can be found in the `design/` folder in the project repository.

## Data Model

The application consists of the following models:
- **User**: Handled by Django's built-in `User` model, extended with a `Profile` model to include additional fields such as a profile picture.
- **Task**: Stores user tasks, including title, description, image, date, and time.

The relationships between these models are documented in `models.py` and are structured using Djangoâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). The database schema is designed to ensure data integrity and organization.

### ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
A visual ERD of the database schema can be found in the `design/` folder of the repository.
